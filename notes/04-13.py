Replace Type Code with Subclasses
Replace Type Code with State / Strategy

subtype / subclass movie
    1. have to change to change the tests
    2. can't change type of movie easily

there are two relationships between classes
    1. inheritance
        a. reuse implementation
        b. reuse interface
        c. can't change your parents
    2. containment
        a. reuse implementation
        b. don't get interface
        c. no problem in changing what you contain

Java
